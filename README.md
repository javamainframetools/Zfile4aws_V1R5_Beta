Zfile4aws, a Java mainframe tool, serves to transmit and retrieve z/OS sequential files from an AWS S3 cloud environment. It accommodates various data sources, including sequential file types and formats like RECFM=PS. Zfile4aws is capable of handling tape files such as DFDSS backup and LBI datasets with large physical block sizes. It empowers users to compress, encrypt, and segment sequential data before transferring it to the cloud. Theoretically, there are no constraints on dataset size for cloud transmission, although actual limits are contingent upon the user's environment and cloud service provider. Zfile4aws operates exclusively in batch mode (JZOS) and supports HFS, ZFS, and OMVS file types. This standalone Java mainframe application is engineered for deployment on z/OS systems, compatible with versions 2.2 and above.# Zfile4aws_V1R5_Beta
